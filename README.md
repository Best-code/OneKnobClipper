# One Knob Clipper
A minimal, no-fluff audio clipper. This plugin is designed with a singular focus: one slider to control the clipping amount. No graphics, no distractions—just efficient, transparent clipping.

### Features
🎚️ One Clipping Control: Adjust the amount of hard clipping applied to the signal.

🔊 Delta Monitoring: Hear exactly what is being clipped.

⛔ Bypass Toggle: Instantly switch the clipper on or off for quick A/B comparisons.

🧼 Minimal Interface: No meters, no visualizers—just functionality.

Why?
This tool is for those who want a straightforward clipper without the bloat. Perfect for gain-staging, mastering, or catching peaks—especially when you want to stay focused on the sound, not the screen.
